# Exercise-Form-Checker
AI-based tool to evaluate workout form using computer vision.

This is still a work in progress, so this README file will most likely be outdated, or completely out of shape. I plan on formatting, summarizing, and finishing this file once I am done with the initial stages of my project. Until then, I'll add information I deem important enough to remember later on :)

Anyone can install dependencies via -> pip install -r requirements.txt
